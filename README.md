# Outlook Signature Tool
An easy way for Organizations to deploy a standardized signature in Outlook. 


## How to deploy this tool in your organization
1) Download the Outlook Signature Tool to some shared location. 
2) Create a folder named 'Templates'.  
3) In Outlook, create a signature. For user fillable fields you want to create, like Full Name and Phone Number, encapsulate these with {* and *}.  Example: {*Full Name*}  
4) When creating a signature (like above) it will create three files and a folder. Navigate to %AppData%\Microsoft\Signatures and grab these three files and folder and copy them into the 'Templates' folder you created above.
5) Congratulations! You just created your first template. 

## How do end users use the tool.
1) They just need to run the executable from their shared drive.
2) Select the template they want to use. (if there is more than one)
3) Fill-in their information and preview it.
4) Push the "Apply to Outlook" button at the bottom.
